# 4d-Tictactoe-game
Me and a friend invented a sort of 4d tic-tac-toe game, I wanted to make it playable on computer/online.

## Rules :
The board is a 3x3 grid where each cell is a tic-tac-toe board by itself.


The player who plays first has to play in the small  board (One of the 9 possibles boards) where the second player wants him to play.
After each turn, the next player has to play in the board that corresponds to the square where the other player played in the small board during their turn.
So for example : if player 1 played in the *bottom right* of the top left board, then player 2 has to play wherever he wants to in the *bottom right board*.

If one of the players complete one of the boards, they earn the whole square, replacing the small board with their symbol.
The first player to align 3 of his symbols on the big board wins. But if no one can do it, it's a tie.
